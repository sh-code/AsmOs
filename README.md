# AsmOs
A theoretical language with the flexibility and dev looseness of JS, specificity of C# and clarity and brevity and syntactical universality of... AsmOS?
Oh, and performance of C/asm, for a good measure, since the syntax tree of a program should be compilable to directly
runnable machine code just by reading and appending leaf values (hex codes/instructions of tokens)

This repo is to store my experiments and thoughts on the way of making this into maybe a thing at least in an interpreted/vm way.&
